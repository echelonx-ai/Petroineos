This readme gives an overview of the two subtasks completed:
1. Energy Demand
2. Coin Machine

Each subtask has it's own respective folder by the same name, that contains the code written for completing this challenge.

## Energy Demand

### Setup
To run the code for energy demand, we use deep learning modelling librariry [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) hence install the necessary requirements to run the file (ideally in virtual env):
``` python
pip install -r ./Energy_Demand/requirements.txt
```
